Hi, I am Chen Sirui Eric (陈思睿). A senior undergraduate student at the University of Hong Kong major in computer science. I am an enthusiast in Robotics and Physics simulation. I hope to use large scale physics simulation to empower a new generation of robot that can be test and verified safely. I am also focusing on how to solve inverse problem and infer physical properties of different object from observation. Currently, I am a research assistant at [The Movement Lab](https://ckllab.stanford.edu) contributing to [nimblephysics](https://nimblephysics.org) for some cool research projects.
