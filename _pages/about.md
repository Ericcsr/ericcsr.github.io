Hi, I am Chen Sirui Eric (陈思睿). A senior undergraduate student at the University of Hong Kong major in computer science. I am an enthusiast in Robotics and Physics simulation and physics based animation. I hope to use large scale differentiable physics simulation to empower a new generation of robot that can be test and verified safely. I am also focusing on how to solve complex control of both animated character and real robot from different source human demonstrations. In 2022, I was fortunate to participate UGVR internship at [The Movement Lab](https://tml.stanford.edu) under the supervision of Professor Karen Liu. I am contributing to [nimblephysics](https://nimblephysics.org) for some cool research projects. Currently, I am actively looking for PhD position starting from Fall 2023.
