Hi, I am Sirui(Eric) Chen (陈思睿). A second year CS PhD student at Stanford advised by Professor [Karen Liu](https://tml.stanford.edu/people/karen-liu). I am generally interested in design robot planning algorithms for contact-rich tasks such as dexterous manipulation and humanoid wholebody loco-manipulation. I am also focusing on how to solve complex control problems in real robot combining different source human demonstrations as well as analytical modeling. In 2022, I was fortunate to participate UGVR internship at [The Movement Lab](https://tml.stanford.edu) and contributed to [nimblephysics](https://nimblephysics.org) for some cool research projects. Feel free to reach out for internship oppotunity or discussing research ideas.
